Space ROS is an open-source spacecraft flight software framework for developing robotic applications for space.
It is designed to be platform independent, portable and project independent.
Space ROS, derived from the ROS 2 framework and conforming to the ROS 2 Application Programming Interface (API), will be hardened to be compatible with the demands of safety-critical space robotics applications.
The intent is Space ROS is to provide a robust framework for space robotic applications where ROS 2 applications can be reused with little to no modification enabling the space community to take advantage of the innovation of the ROS community.
This will shorten the time for development of novel space robotics capabilities, enable reuse of capabilities between missions, and lower the life-cycle cost of new robotic missions.

This site provides the documentation for Space ROS.
